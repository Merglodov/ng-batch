## Components

**Custom overlay** - allows to open any content in a modal like material menus. Could be used for custom datepickers or any other staff. Personaly I'm using it for custom pickers and datepicker which has different representation for desktop and mobile

**JWT Auth with refresh token** - includes https interceptor which set auth headers and handle 401 issues to retrive access token
